Context for GPT: LinkedIn Job Application Automation Project

The user is building a custom Selenium-based automation tool for applying to jobs on LinkedIn, with plans to extend it to Naukri.com later. The goal is to automate Easy Apply job applications for AI/ML/Data Science roles in Hyderabad/Bangalore with a salary of 12 LPA or above. The script should also track applied jobs in an Excel file and provide WhatsApp/email notifications for follow-ups.

Progress So Far:
âœ… Successfully implemented LinkedIn login automation
âœ… Navigated to job search results based on a predefined URL
âœ… Implemented logic to iterate through job listings
âœ… Identified and clicked on Easy Apply buttons if available
âœ… Handled stale element reference errors using dynamic re-selection
âœ… Ensured proper scrolling and waiting before interactions

Pending Tasks & Next Steps:
ðŸ”¹ Form Auto-Filling: Automate filling out the Easy Apply form (handling text inputs, file uploads, dropdowns)
ðŸ”¹ Error Handling Improvements: Add retry mechanisms for failed applications
ðŸ”¹ Job Tracking: Store applied jobs in an Excel file (with job title, company, application status, timestamp)
ðŸ”¹ Notifications: Implement WhatsApp/email alerts for successful applications and follow-ups
ðŸ”¹ Naukri.com Integration: Extend automation to work for Naukri.com job applications

Key Considerations:
The script should NOT apply randomlyâ€”only for jobs that meet the userâ€™s criteria
The user does NOT want to use third-party LinkedIn automation toolsâ€”it must be fully custom-coded
Separate timelines: First, build a quick MVP focusing on LinkedIn. Then refine it into a fully polished tool
Current Ask: The user now needs to extend the script to auto-fill Easy Apply forms, ensuring it can handle text fields, dropdowns, and file uploads (resume submission) dynamically. The solution must be robust and account for different form structures LinkedIn may present.

Immediate Task:
Enhance the script to auto-fill and submit Easy Apply forms dynamically, handling multiple input types.
